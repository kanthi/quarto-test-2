# Intro
TCP IP is a network protocol that enables communication between devices on a network. It is a set of protocols that define how data is transferred over the network.

## TCP
TCP is a reliable, connection-based protocol that provides a way for two devices to exchange data over a network. It ensures that data is delivered in order and without errors.

## IP
IP is a network protocol that assigns unique addresses to devices on a network. It is used to identify and communicate with devices on a network.

## OSI Model
The OSI model is a framework for understanding how data is transferred over a network. It divides the network into layers, each with a specific purpose and responsibilities.

## OSI Layers
The OSI model has 7 layers, each with a specific purpose and responsibilities:
- Physical Layer: Handles the physical connection between devices
- Data Link Layer: Handles the transmission of data between devices
- Network Layer: Handles the routing and delivery of data between devices
- Transport Layer: Handles the delivery of data between devices
- Session Layer: Handles the creation and management of sessions between devices
- Presentation Layer: Handles the presentation of data to the user
- Application Layer: Handles the application-specific logic of the data

## TCP/IP Stack
The TCP/IP stack is a set of protocols that provide the underlying network infrastructure for TCP/IP. It includes protocols such as IP, TCP, and UDP.
