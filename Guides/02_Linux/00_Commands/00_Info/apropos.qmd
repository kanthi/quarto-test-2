## Overview

The `apropos` command searches the manual page names and descriptions for a specific keyword. It's useful for finding commands when you don't remember their exact names.

## Syntax

```bash
apropos [options] keyword
```

## Common Options

- `-a`: Display only matches that satisfy all keywords
- `-r`: Use regular expressions for searching
- `-s sections`: Look only in given manual sections
- `-l`: List only page names

## Examples

```bash
# Find commands related to passwords
apropos password
# Shows all commands with "password" in their description

# Search with multiple keywords
apropos -a user password
# Shows commands containing both "user" and "password"

# Use regex pattern
apropos -r '^find.*'
# Lists all commands starting with "find"
```

## Tips

1. Use when you can't remember the exact command name
2. Combine with `man` to read full documentation
3. More detailed than `whatis`
4. Great for discovering new commands
