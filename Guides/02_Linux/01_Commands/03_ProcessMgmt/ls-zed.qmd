## Using the ls command {.sec-ls-command}

The `ls` command is one of the most commonly used commands in Linux and Unix systems. It is used to list the contents of a directory.

### Basic Usage

The basic syntax is:

```bash
ls [options] [directory]
```

If no directory is specified, ls will show contents of the current directory.

### Common Options

Some frequently used options include:

- `-l`: Long listing format showing detailed file information
- `-a`: Show all files including hidden ones (starting with .)  
- `-h`: Human readable file sizes
- `-R`: Recursive listing of subdirectories
- `-t`: Sort by modification time
- `-S`: Sort by file size

### Examples

List current directory contents:
```bash 
ls
```

Show detailed file information:
```bash
ls -l
```

Show hidden files:
```bash
ls -la
```

List files recursively in subdirectories:
```bash
ls -R
```

Show files sorted by size in human readable format:
```bash
ls -lhS
```

### Output Explanation

When using `ls -l`, the output shows:

- File permissions 
- Number of hard links
- Owner name
- Group name
- File size
- Last modified date/time
- Filename

For example:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x  2 user group 4096 Jan 1 10:00 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user group  123 Jan 1 09:00 file.txt
```

The `ls` command is essential for navigating and managing files in Unix-like systems.
